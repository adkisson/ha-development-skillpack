# Home Assistant Skill Pack

**An idiosyncratic prompt, design principles, and pattern set for working with Home Assistant YAML/Jinja**

---

## What this is

This repository contains a **[skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) pack** I use when vibe coding (h/t to Anthropic, but it also works as a project file with ChatGPT) with Home Assistant YAML and Jinja.  It compiles and documents the things that have worked and approaches to fix those that LLMs still get wrong much of the time.

It is:

* based on **my** HA instance and interests (and strong opinions about what works for me)
* a common set of design principles and guidelines,
* a set of constraints,
* a mental model for discussing automations,
* a collection of trial-and-error solutions from a hobbyist, 
* and incomplete.

It reflects how *I* currently think about HA coding — not a universal framework or best-practice guide.

---

## What this is not

* Not a drop-in HA set of automations, scripts, etc.
* Not guaranteed to be correct for anyone else's setup
* Not an exhaustive skill for all domains of HA
* Not an official HA approach

---

## Why it exists

As my desire for HA functionality far outstripped my own ability to code (or even structurally think through the setup), I turned to LLMs to see if I could augment my skills.  After a few small automation enhancements, I realized that I was going to get nowhere without very structured documentation of prompts, constraints, and gotchas.  Those started well before Anthropic introduced skills and form the basis of everything here.

## Feedback welcome

I’m sharing this in the hope that others will spot flaws, failure modes, or better ways to structure the same ideas.

If your reaction is *“this wouldn’t work for me,”* that’s expected — it's tailored to my way of organizing my thoughts and to my specific interests in HA.  Even so, I hope that some of the structure and guidelines at least spark useful thoughts/discussion.
